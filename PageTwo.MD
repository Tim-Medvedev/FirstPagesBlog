# Running 
## And Exercise!

I love exercise and am an avid runner. Completing new routes around the city is one of my favorite activites and there's nothing better then
feeling fresh after a good run outside. I also am attempting to do more calisthenics and am always looking to improve the way I do exercises.
I am a firm believer in exercise being extremely beneficial to someone's mental and physical wellbeing, and I think it is an underrated way to get 
certain energies out and improve your work ethic.
