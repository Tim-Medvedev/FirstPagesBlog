# Hiking!
Hiking is one of my absolute favorite activites and I love spending time outdoors discovering new places to visit. I've done numerous hikes in Washington and small mountains
but I still aspire to climb big mountains such as Mount Ranier and Baker.

The picture included is from the Enchantments outside of Leavenworth. I just did it this Autumn and it was amazing
