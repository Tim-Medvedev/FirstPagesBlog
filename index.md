# Introduction

Hello! My name is Tim Medvedev and I was born in St. Petersburg Russia in the year 2000. My family first moved to the US in 2003 where we lived in North Carolina
until I was 10 years old, when we moved to a small town outside of Pittsburgh where I eventually finished high school. I came to UW Seattle immediately after and after trying out different majors such as German and Informatics I decided to transfer to Uw Bothell for Computer Science. In this little blog website I will describe some of my interests.
